2K6Ci0mz6nc,Pathankot attack: The blame game begins,"All six terrorists involved in the Pathankot air base attack have been killed, four days after it first began. Pakistan Prime Minister called PM Modi and assured him of full support in the terror investigations. Even though no Indian official has said so, a Pakistan foreign ministry statement late Monday night said India had shared information regarding the attack. Security forces are still combing the area to clear the base of explosives, but as the dust settles, questions over security lapses are mounting - the Gurdaspur Superintendent of Police whose car was hijacked is being debriefed, but where does the buck stop when it comes to responsibility for delayed responses to the first security alert on New Year's eve?

2OHsaKUTeZA,"Indira Gandhi Ignored Advice To Demonetise, Sold Out India: PM Modi","Prime Minister Narendra Modi today levelled charges against two former premiers, his predecessor Dr Manmohan Singh and Indira Gandhi, of ignoring basic steps to fight corruption. Obvious and recommended methods include demonetisation, he told his party's parliamentarians this morning, at a time when his government is being asked to explain the vast cash crunch forged by its sudden cancellation of 500-and 1,000-rupee notes a little over a month ago. The Prime Minister's address to his party lawmakers were made on the last day of this session of Parliament which accomplished close to nothing because of daily disruptions over the demonetisation drive.

As the Centre tries to deal with the enormous task, the Opposition is all set to take them on in the Parliament tomorrow. Mamata Banerjee, who is going to march to the President's House tomorrow, has got BJP's ally, the Shiv Sena, on board. Even the Supreme Court has said that the common man shouldn't suffer. So is this cash clean-up going to work in the long run?

470kIwPvXuQ,Best of Nazrul Geeti by Dhirendra Chandra Mitra | Bengali Songs of Kazi Nazrul Islam,"Presenting a compilation of Nazrul Geeti or Songs of Nazrul that showcases some of the rare Bengali Songs written by Nazrul in the form of Shyama Sangeet and other Hindu devotional song format. Kazi Nazrul Islam the name requires no introduction. The national poet of Bangladesh earned the title of “Rebel Poet” for his fiery revolutionary writings. He was also a Bengali polymath, poet, writer, musician and revolutionary. Popularly known as Nazrul, his poetry and music espoused Indo-Islamic renaissance and intense spiritual rebellion against fascism and oppression. Nazrul's writings explore themes such as love, freedom, and revolution; he opposed all bigotry, including religion and gender. Throughout his career, Nazrul wrote short stories, novels, and essays but is best known for his poems, in which he pioneered new forms such as Bengali ghazals. Nazrul wrote and composed music for his nearly 4,000 songs (including gramophone records), collectively known as Nazrul geeti (Songs of Nazrul), which are widely popular today. In what his contemporaries regarded as one of his greatest flairs of creativity, Nazrul began composing the very first ghazals in Bengali, transforming a form of poetry written mainly in Persian and Urdu. Nazrul became the first person to introduce Islam into the larger mainstream tradition of Bengali music. The first record of Islamic songs by Nazrul Islam was a commercial success and many gramophone companies showed interest in producing these. A significant impact of Nazrul was that it drew made Muslims more comfortable in the Bengali Arts, which used to be dominated by Hindus. Nazrul also composed a number of notable Shamasangeet, Bhajan and Kirtan, combining Hindu devotional music. Arousing controversy and passions in his readers, Nazrul's ideas attained great popularity across India. In 1928, Nazrul began working as a lyricist, composer and music director for His Master's Voice Gramophone Company. The songs written and music composed by him were broadcast on radio stations across the country. He was also enlisted/attached with the Indian Broadcasting Company.

All songs compiled here are sung by the legendary Nazrul Geeti artist Shri Dhirendra Chandra Mitra. The soulful voice and melodious renditions of popular Nazrul Geeti like Shashaney Jagichhey Shyama and Brojo Gopi Khele Hori are a real treat that this compilation offers to a listener.

Prabodh Chandra Dey (1 May 1919) better known by his nickname Manna Dey, is a playback singer in Hindi, Bengali, Gujarati, Marathi, Malayalam, Kannada, Assamese films. Along with Mohammed Rafi, Kishore Kumar, Mukesh he was a part of Indian film playback music industry. He is rated as the best classical singer among all singers of Hindi film music, though he sang various types of songs from pop to folk. He has recorded more than 3500 songs over the course of his career. The Government of India honored him with the Padma Shri in 1971, the Padma Bhushan in 2005 and the Dadasaheb Phalke Award in 2007.
Padmabhusan Manna Dey is a legendary figure in Indian music. His fame is not restricted to the Indian domain only but has over flown to every part of the globe, where an Indian heart resides. In fact his is not merely a name that is deified everywhere, rather it creates a ripple of mixed feeling of love and worship whenever cited. People venerate him not only for his musical bearing but because he epitomizes a wonderful combination of melody and poetry. His stance in Indian music vindicates the axiom -- the art outlives the artist.

62l3zLTKXAU,Note Ban U-Turns: Dent In RBI's Credibility?,"There have been 60 changes in rules in just over 40 days following demonetisation. Rules governing the exchange of old notes have been changed five times, rules governing withdrawal limits have been changed six times, those governing the use of old notes have been changed eight times. But it's the latest flip-flop by the RBI that has attracted maximum criticism - they said multiple deposits of over 5,000 rupees would attract questions and then did a turnaround after a massive outcry. The opposition is now alleging that the central bank has lost all semblance of being an autonomous institution. Is the attack on the RBI justified?

:: Bengali Lyrics ::

আমি যে জলসাঘরের
বেলোয়াড়ী ঝাড়।
নিশি ফুরালে কেহ
চায় না আমায় জানি গো আর।।
আমি যে আতর ওগো
আতরদানী ভরা।
আমারই কাজ হলো যে
গন্ধে খুশী করা।
কে তারে রাখে মনে
ফুরালে হায় গন্ধ যে তার।।
হায় গো কী যে আগুন
জ্বলে বুকের মাঝে।
বুঝেও তবু বলতে পারি না যে
আলেয়ার পিছে আমি
মিছেই ছুটে যাই বারে বার।।

It is helping even men like Harishankar Pandey, a pan shop owner in Delhi, with customers using apps and e-wallets to make small value transactions. ""This is very practical. On an average, about 20-25 persons use apps like Paytm, Swiggy every day,"" said Mr Pandey.

a9Vsdd9DIZI,Best of Nazrul Geeti by Firoza Begum | Manabendra Mukherjee Bengali Songs,"Nazrul Geeti is a genre of Bengali Songs that originates from the works of the great rebel poet Kazi Nazrul Islam. Nazrul Geeti that literally translates to be songs of Nazrul is an integral part of Bengali culture. This compilation of Nazrul Geeti has some of the greatest Nazrul Geeti artists like Feroza Begum and Manabendra Mukherjee. Firoza Begum happened to be a direct disciple of Kazi Nazrul Islam. Feroza Begum is renowned for her Gazal Gayaki and Nazrul is the first Bengali composer who introduced Gazal in Bengali Songs. Manabendra Mukherji on the other hand is one of the greatest Bengali playback singers. But his fondness for Nazrul Geeti made him record several Nazrul Geeti records and thus made Manabendra Mukherji a house hold name when it came to Nazrul Geeti artists.

Kazi nazrul Islam who is fondly remembered as “Nazrul” or the “Bidrohi Kobi” (literally means the rebellious poet) was born in the village of Churulia in the Burdwan district which is in West Bengal now.  Kazi Nazrul Islam created an avant-garde genre of modern Bengali Songs. He wrote and composed these songs himself. This entire genre was termed later on as Nazrul Geeti or songs of Kazi Nazrul Islam. Nazrul wrote and composed music for his nearly 4,000 songs.

Kazi Nazrul Islam was highly motivated by the nationalist freedom movements and preached revolution through his poetic works, such as Bidrohi (The Rebel) and Bhangar Gaan (The Song of Destruction), as well as his publication Dhumketu (The Comet). He was hailed captive by the British Raaj many a times. Kazi Nazrul Islam fiercely inspired Bengalis during the Bangladesh Liberation War. Nazrul is held as the national poet of Bangladesh. 
This assorted compilation of Nazrul Geeti has some of the most popular Nazrul songs sung by some of the greatest artists, many of whom were direct disciples of Kazi Nazrul Islam. Nazrul became the first person to introduce Islam into the larger mainstream tradition of Bengali music. Nazrul also composed some notable Shyama Sangeet, Kirtan and Bhajan which were essentially Hindu art forms. He was deeply influenced by the Arabic and Persian melodies. Which reflects mainly through his compositions. This compilation has songs sung by Feroza Begum, Suprava Sarkar and Sachin Dev Burman who were all direct disciples of Kazi Nazrul Islam. Songs like Koohu Koohu Koyelia and Rum Jhuma Rum Jhuma are a classic example of Kazi Nazrul Islam's profound compositional knowledge. With some of the biggest names in Nazrul Geeti this compilation “Assorted Songs Of Kazi Nazrul Islam” is a must have.

AJYDvxDJW7k,Humour to Help Swallow the 'Bitter Pill' of Demonetisation,"On Hum Log, amidst all the bickering over demonetization, comedians Neeti Palta, Raju Srivastav and RJ Naved bring out the humour in the situation. Some of the participants in the show say they faced problems at hospitals or other institutions that flouted government rules and turned them away because they didn't have the new currency notes. Should the government be answerable to the problems being faced by people due to cash crunch or should we treat these issues as hiccups following the implementation of a policy that will help India in the long run? We ask. (Audio in Hindi)

aQL2OSLKtp0,Note Ban Shock Is Good For India: Nandan Nilekani To NDTV,"Nandan Nilekani, who shaped the world's largest biometric database with India's Aadhaar project, is confident that the government's ban on 500 and 1,000 rupee notes will ensure financial inclusion surges. Mr Nilekani, co-founder of IT giant Infosys, predicated digital transactions will escalate considerably in the next 3-6 months to a rate that would otherwise have taken ""3 to 6 years."" Mr Nilekani said that any short-term contraction in economic growth will be compensated for very quickly ""with digitization.""

Aadhaar, which assigns a unique identity (UID) to every citizen linked to their biometrics, is key to helping rural India open zero-balance or Jan Dhan bank accounts and to avail of direct cash transfers to the poor through welfare schemes.

In 2014, Mr Nilekani ran unsuccessfully for parliament as a Congress candidate from Bengaluru.

""The credit for creating the Aadhaar system goes to the UPA government, Dr Manmohan Singh,"" said Mr Nilekani, referring to the former Prime Minister. ""At the same time, am grateful to PM Modi because he has taken what was built and applied it to so many schemes...this government took it forward,"" he said about how the Aadhaar project has been increasingly utilized. 

""A lot will depend on the next three months. If they accelerate digitization... long-term, it will be a very good development,"" he said.

Alpana Banerjee's major popularity derived from singing children's songs, which she transformed from simple rhymes to immortal classics. Bengalis from the 1950s through the 1990s were raised on Alpana's classics like 'Hattim Attim Tim' or 'Chhotto Pakhi Chandana'.
Her non-children songs also received considerable popularity. One of the earliest and notable Bengali non-film songs sung by Alpana was ""Samiran Phire Chao"" under Robin Chattopadhyay's baton. Soon after, in 1951, she recorded the song ""Matir Ghare Aaj Nemechhe Chand Re"" for the Bengali film 'Vidyasagar' with music once again by Robin Chattopadhay. This song became remarkably popular.

NDTV has learnt that Mr Sharif has personally thrown his weight behind the need to register a case in the Pathankot terror attack. Who the First Information Report or FIR will name - and whether it will specifically list the Jaish-e-Mohammed as a terror group - is what India is waiting to see.

BrEkq5XWP5w,"Rural Service Providers, Traders Adamant on Cash-Only Payments","On Prime Time, we present a ground report from rural areas of Muradnagar in Uttar Pradesh where people who have to host weddings have to make several trips to banks to draw money. The reason is obvious: Traders, caterers and service providers for weddings blindly refuse to accept cheque based payments. When contacted, the tent supplier said that his employees do not want to take cheques. Two weeks after the announcement of demonetization, supply chain in villages continues to be choked because of each individual demanding only cash as payment for their goods and services.

How long will this disruption continue? But most importantly, why is it so that while thousands of citizens stand in queues, waiting to withdraw their hard earned money, our television screens flash hoards of new cash being seized from all across the country? Has black money wriggled its way back into the system? As we take stock of the situation, we revisit the six crucial questions we asked in our last episode - Will this lead to windfall gains for the government? What will happen with the banks? Will there be a budget bonanza? Will black money be blacked out? Will the generation of black black money be curtailed in the future? And finally, how long will this disruption continue? As the weeks pass and time closes in on the Prime Minister Narendra Modi's 50-day promise, we see if our experts still hold the same opinion that they did when the PM's scheme was first announced on November 8th.
